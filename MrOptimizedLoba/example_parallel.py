# starts with an array of 256 ones
# for loop with my kernel for loop
# multiplies 2 for each index with threads
#cuda.grid(1) is the same as block id times x.
# the index.
# main problem is the number of things going on
# separate arrays before for loop
# Numpy arrays automatically move between GPU and CPU
