# Mt Etna 2001 LFS1 flow field

This folder contains the files to simulate the Mt Etna 2001 LFS1 flow field, which formed from July 18 to August 9 from a vent located at about 2100 m elevation near Monti Calcarazzi (Coltelli et al. 2007). The cumulative volume of lava emplaced is known from the existing literature (Coltelli et al. 2007), and the map of the lava deposit thickness has been already presented by Tarquini and Favalli (2011). Here we used as pre-emplacement topography the 10 m-resolution TINITALY digital elevation model (Tarquini et al. 2007).
